    <h2>Future of E-Learning</h2>
    
    <section>
      <h3>Virtual Reality (VR)</h3>
      <p>One exciting development in e-learning technology is the use of virtual reality (VR) to create immersive learning experiences. With VR, learners can explore simulations and scenarios that would be difficult or impossible to recreate in real life, allowing them to practice skills and gain knowledge in a safe and controlled environment.</p>
      <p>As VR technology continues to improve and become more affordable, we can expect to see more widespread adoption of VR in e-learning systems in the coming years.</p>

      <h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>
      <p>Another trend in e-learning is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to personalize the learning experience for each individual student. AI-powered systems can analyze data about each learner's progress, preferences, and interests to recommend personalized learning resources and activities.</p>
      <p>AI can also be used to automate routine tasks such as grading and feedback, freeing up instructors' time to focus on more valuable interactions with students.</p>

      <h3>Gamification</h3>
      <p>Gamification is the use of game-like elements such as points, badges, and leaderboards in non-game contexts like education. Gamification can make learning more engaging and motivating by giving learners clear goals and rewards for their efforts.</p>
      <p>In the future, we can expect to see even more sophisticated gamification techniques in e-learning systems, such as adaptive games that adjust to each individual learner's needs and abilities.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h3>Mobile Learning</h3>
      <p>As smartphones and tablets become more ubiquitous, mobile learning is becoming an increasingly popular way to deliver education and training. Mobile learning allows learners to access course materials and participate in activities from anywhere, at any time.</p>
      <p>In the future, we can expect to see more e-learning systems optimized for mobile devices, with responsive design and mobile-friendly interfaces that make it easy to learn on the go.</p>
